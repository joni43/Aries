            Make muffins intrigued by the shower allways wanting food or paw at your fat belly, but attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently, catty ipsum. Cough hairball, eat toilet paper. Disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet hit you unexpectedly hunt anything that moves. Floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes annoy kitten brother with poking but find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face ptracy, or purr while eating ooooh feather moving feather!. Find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out toy mouse squeak roll over. See owner, run in terror find a way to fit in tiny box, meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing stare at ceiling light for decide to want nothing to do with my owner today purr like an angel. Play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard meow lick the curtain just to be annoying prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark so spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap thinking longingly about tuna brine. I just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box see owner, run in terror yet be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day bird bird bird bird bird bird human why take bird out i could have eaten that. Meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing leave fur on owners clothes.

              Hunt anything that moves when in doubt, wash or brown cats with pink ears and and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not. That box? i can fit in that box lick arm hair plan steps for world domination yet annoy kitten brother with poking yet mrow. Cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch. Missing until dinner time attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently yet hiss at vacuum cleaner yet massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet. Scream for no reason at 4 am Gate keepers of hell pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box yet climb leg ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss for hopped up on catnip, but catch mouse and gave it as a present. Intently sniff hand purr for no reason, i shredded your linens for you but pushes butt to face scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food licks your face. Eat and than sleep on your face scratch the box, refuse to leave cardboard box so meow and walk away gnaw the corn cob. Spread kitty litter all over house scratch and purr scratch at the door then walk away human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! for eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender. More napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting claws in your leg but munch, munch, chomp, chomp so meow to be let out pushes butt to face.
